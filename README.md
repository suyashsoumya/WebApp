1. Re-visit your web application and review for web vulnerabilities as well as an app from one other student. Please use the forums to find another student to pair with. 

2. Update your app to mitigate the issues found from step 2 and document the changes made, as well as your reasoning for the changes you've chosen. 

3. Produce a write up of the vulnerabilities you've found in your fellow student's app. You do not need to update their app as they will be doing this themselves.
